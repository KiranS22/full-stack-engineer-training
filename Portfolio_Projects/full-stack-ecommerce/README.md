### .env Files

In order for this project to work locally on youer device, you will need to:

1. Install the dependencies (npm install OR npm i )
2. configure the .env files to run on your machine.

This project has 2 .env files - a frontend and backend. Both of these files contain variables that are specific to the way that I set up my :

- database and tables
- API Routes
- sessions
- payment proccessor

An environment variables (env) file relates to valiables that are specific to eacgh part of the application (frontend and backend implementation.) To customise them so that they intergrate into your own project...

Navigate to the frontend or backenx folder > Click on .env and edit the variable names as you see approprate. If you do not customise the environmrnt variables you may expirence erors with the code in this repository.

## Things I've learnt whilst making this oroject

I made this project as part of the 'full-Stack Engineer Career Path' on Codecademy. This is my first ever PERN-Stack app, so as you can imagine I have learnt alot during this process.

One of the things that I have learnt is, how to use pool to connect and query a PSQL database in a project. I learnt this by following the pool docs and addapting my code accordingly.

I've also discovered protected routes are used in React-Router to only show routes based on a certain vodition in an application. I Whilst on the topic of React-Router, I built this project using version 6.4.2, but I am aware that in the midst of building this app, the syntax has been updated slightly. With this in mind, I will be updating the React-Router syntax in due-tine.

Another thing that I have learnt is how remote databses work. Prior to building this application I was not aware of what a remote database was or how they worked. Instead, I was using PgAdmin and the commandline to create a local databse.

This was a problem when it came to attempting to deploy the application, as I had to host a version of my local database in order for the application to work. To comvate this I did some reserach into remote databases and the different options when it came to hosting sites and how to connect the remote databse and my local datavase. This was something I struggled with greatly because I had to pukll information together from various sources. However once I completed it I felt a great sense of achievement when I finally managed to do it.

The final and most important thing that I've learnt whilst building this project is gow to problem-solve, debug and persevere. Theese are vital skills for a developer and I believe that I am well on my way to perfecting these skills and building ny confidence in the future.
