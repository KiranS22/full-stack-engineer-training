              <h1>Bora Bora</h1>
              <p>
                Bora Bora is a small South Pacific island northwest of Tahiti in
                French Polynesia.<br /><br />
                peaceful haven sitting directly over the lagoon, the overwater
                bungalow concept is a can’t-miss element of Bora Bora and The
                Islands of Tahiti. From rooms, suites of floating villas, lose
                yourself in the colors of the lagoon framed by unforgettable
                sunsets. Designed and built in traditional Tahitian style, these
                bungalows offer direct access to the lagoon and are the perfect
                relaxing getaway.

              <h1>Amalfi Coast</h1>
              <p>
                The Amalfi Coast is a stretch of coastline in southern Italy
                overlooking the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Gulf of Salerno.<br />
                <br />
                Italy's Amalfi Coast boasts a classic Mediterranean landscape, a
                sensual blend of both natural and cultural wonders. The
                breathtaking terrain includes dramatic coastline topography
                scattered with terraced vineyards, orchards, and pastures—often
                with enchanting views of the vibrant waters below.

              <h1>Plitvice Lakes</h1>
              <p>
                The Plitvice Lakes National Park, Croatia’s most popular tourist
                attraction, was granted UNESCO World Heritage status in 1979.
                Located roughly halfway between capital city Zagreb and Zadar on
                the coast, the lakes are a definite must-see in Croatia. (As
                confirmed by the many emails we’ve received!) <br />
                <br />

                The beauty of the National Park lies in its sixteen lakes,
                inter-connected by a series of waterfalls, and set in deep
                woodland populated by deer, bears, wolves, boars and rare bird
                species. The National Park covers a total area of 300 square
                kilometres, whilst the lakes join together over a distance of
                eight kilometres.
