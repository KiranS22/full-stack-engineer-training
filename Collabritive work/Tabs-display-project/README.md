### Barriers and how we overcame them 

- **Timezones** We both are from different parts of the world so we chose to get around that by working out the time difference, and planning tasks according to our schedules. 

- **Understanding each other's code**  When dividing up the rolls in this project, we wanted to push ourselves out of what we were comfortable with. As a result of this, Jordan did the HTML and I (Kiran), did the JavaScript.

As HTML and JavaScript work together to provide the functionality in our app, it was vital that we understood each others code. To ensure that this was achieved, we left comments explaining sections of our code and/or its functionality. This meant that, the workflow was smoth and we where able to complete the project at a resonable pace.
